# [CareerOS]([https://github.com](https://career-os-v2.vercel.app/))

CareerOS is an AI-assisted career intelligence operating system connecting student evidence, university readiness, and employer talent discovery.

CareerOS connects three workspaces through one shared intelligence system: students turn real activity into evidence, universities see readiness and programme-market gaps, and employers discover talent through explainable skill signals. The current repository is a hackathon frontend prototype that demonstrates the intended product experience with mock data and simulated AI-assisted workflows.

## Product Overview

### Student Workspace

Students can:

- Capture projects, internships, events, certifications, and activities in Career Memory.
- Build evidence-backed skill profiles.
- Understand readiness, skill gaps, and career direction.
- Receive page-specific guidance from the AI Career Companion.
- Discover relevant events, jobs, and saved opportunities.
- Track applications through a visual pipeline.

Current visible areas: Overview, Career Memory, Career Intelligence, Opportunities, Applications, Network & Mentors, Learning & Skills.

Network & Mentors and Learning & Skills are intentionally minimal placeholder areas in the current demo.

### University Workspace

Universities can:

- Monitor programme-market alignment.
- Identify emerging skill gaps.
- Analyse student readiness by programme and cohort.
- Review alumni outcome signals.
- Manage collaboration opportunities before events.
- Measure post-event impact, student outcomes, and collaboration value.

Current visible areas: Overview, Program-Market Alignment, Alumni Signals, Student Readiness, Collaboration Marketplace.

The demo university persona is Dr. Evelyn Chen, Dean of Computing & AI at Heriot-Watt University Malaysia, School of Mathematical & Computer Sciences.

### Employer Workspace

Employers can:

- Discover evidence-backed candidates.
- Review explainable fit and skill evidence.
- Save searches and shortlist talent.
- Create student engagement programmes.
- Respond to club or university engagement opportunities.
- Publish jobs and manage applicant workflows.

Current visible areas: Talent Discovery, Create Engagement, Job Marketplace, Saved Searches, Shortlists.

## Core Product Flow

```text
Student activity
-> Career Memory
-> Skill evidence
-> Career Intelligence
-> Opportunities and applications
-> University and employer outcomes
-> Better future guidance
```

```text
Student evidence
-> University intelligence
-> Employer action
-> Outcomes feed back into CareerOS
```

## Key Differentiators

- Evidence-first Career Memory instead of resume-only claims.
- Three connected workspaces for students, universities, and employers.
- Program-Market Alignment for curriculum and intervention decisions.
- Explainable talent discovery based on skill evidence.
- Collaboration and event impact intelligence.
- Embedded AI assistance that summarizes page-specific priorities.
- Action-oriented recommendations across readiness, opportunities, and engagement.

## Current Demo Status

The current version is a frontend prototype using mock data and simulated AI-assisted workflows to demonstrate the intended product experience.

This prototype uses:

- React + Vite
- React Router
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide React icons
- Zustand local state where needed
- Mock data
- Simulated AI-assisted logic

It does not include:

- A production backend
- Production authentication
- A persistent production database
- Live institutional integrations
- Live employer integrations
- Real labour-market data feeds
- Real traction, customer, or partnership claims

## Demo Workspaces

| Workspace | Main areas |
| --- | --- |
| Student | Overview, Career Memory, Career Intelligence, Opportunities, Applications |
| University | Overview, Program-Market Alignment, Alumni Signals, Student Readiness, Collaboration Marketplace |
| Employer | Talent Discovery, Create Engagement, Job Marketplace, Saved Searches, Shortlists |

## Featured Demo Flows

### Student Flow

```text
Experience
-> Career Memory
-> Skill evidence
-> Career Intelligence
-> Opportunities
-> Applications
```

### University Flow

```text
Programme-market gap
-> Recommended intervention
-> Collaboration event
-> Post-event impact intelligence
```

### Employer Flow

```text
Candidate discovery
-> Evidence review
-> Explainable fit
-> Shortlist or engagement
```

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

On Windows PowerShell, if script execution blocks `npm`, use:

```powershell
npm.cmd install
npm.cmd run dev
```

## Available Scripts

These scripts are defined in `package.json`:

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the Vite development server. |
| `npm run build` | Build the production bundle. |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally. |

There is currently no `lint` script in `package.json`.

## Technology Stack

Frontend
-----------

- React
- Vite
- JavaScript / JSX
- React Router
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide React
- Zustand
- Mock data and local state

Backend (Future Development)
----------------------------
- FastAPI
- Google ADK for agent orchestration 
  1) Resource agent: To extract useful and relevant resources for the user (student/candidates) roadmap 
  2) Roadmap agent: To create a roadmap based on the skills landscape of the users 
  3) Analysis agent: Analyse the readiness of the candidates and create a matching score 
  4) Admin agent: Helping applicants and employer to create an email/message draft and schedule an interview 
- PostgreSQL 
  - Common Database for saving contents
  - Vector database for saving text embedding 
- Google Cloud for hosting 
- Authentication
  - Google 
  - LinkedIn


## Current Prototype Limitations

- Demo content is powered by mock data.
- AI recommendations, summaries, match scores, and assistant messages are simulated.
- Authentication is role-selection based and not backed by a production identity system.
- There is no persistent production database.
- There is no real labour-market data feed.
- There is no live university, employer, LMS, SIS, ATS, or HRIS integration.
- Metrics shown in the interface are illustrative demo values.
- Some legacy route aliases remain for stability but are not separate active product modules.

## Future Direction

Potential next steps include:

- Real AI extraction, retrieval, and recommendation services.
- Live market-demand and skill-demand data.
- Syllabus and course ingestion for programme skill coverage.
- QR or attendance-based event participation verification.
- Verified institutional and employer integrations.
- Longitudinal outcome intelligence.
- Institutional benchmarking across cohorts, programmes, and faculties.
